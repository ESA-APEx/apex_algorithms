## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms for benchmarking and cataloguing within the APEx framework. Explore detailed performance comparisons, usage guidelines, and implementation notes to help you select and apply the best algorithms for your needs.

### Benchmarking

The benchmarking section offers standardized tests and metrics to evaluate algorithm efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. You will find instructions on running benchmarks, interpreting results, and comparing different approaches.

### Catalogue

The catalogue lists all available algorithms, grouped by category and application. Each entry includes a description, usage examples, and links to source code and documentation, making it easy to discover and integrate algorithms into your projects.

Start by browsing the catalogue or running benchmarks to find the optimal solutions for your tasks.
