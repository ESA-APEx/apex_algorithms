The Plant Phenology Index (PPI) is a satellite-based vegetation index designed to monitor vegetation growth cycles (phenology) with improved sensitivity during early spring green-up and late autumn senescence. Unlike traditional indices like NDVI, PPI maintains a linear relationship with green leaf area index (LAI) across the entire growing season.

This openEO process calculates PPI using Sentinel-2 data and MDVI reference collections.
