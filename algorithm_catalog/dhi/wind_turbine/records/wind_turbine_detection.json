    "description": "# Description\n\nDetects wind turbines in open landscapes using Sentinel-2 imagery and a pre-trained computer vision object detection model.\nOpen landscapes can be considered all landscapes outside of built-up urban and peri-urban areas together with forested areas. \nIn general open landscapes is mainly comprised of open agricultural land and nature areas. \n\nThe user selects a region of interest and specifies a year to analyze. \nThe best available Sentinel-2 imagery for the selected region is ranked based on quality metrics and\nthe highest ranked image is chosen for wind turbine detection, based on several ranking parameters. \nThe Sentinel-2 imagery is then passed to the pre-trained neural network that returns the bounding boxes \nfor each detected turbine. Wind turbines are reported with a detection probability on the scale\nof 0 - 1. The higher the probability of the detection, the higher confidence that it is a TRUE detection.\n\nAdditional filtering is applied to account for multiple detections in close proximity. \nThe end result includes a .geojson file defining the bounding box of all wind turbine detections \nwith the detection date and probability as attributes. The service is so far applicable\nto Central Europe, with plans to expand further. \n\n\n# Performance characteristics\n\nThe costs of this service are based on the requested output area, making it independent of platform performance.\nAn example run of 220kmÂ² takes up to 30 minutes to complete, while smaller test areas complete drastically faster. \n\n\n# Examples\n\nBelow we overlay a Sentinel2-RGB image with the ML classification, thereby highlighting the detected areas.\n\n![wind_turbine_output](wind_turbine_example.png)\n\n# Known limitations\n\nWorks in open landscapes only, see description.",
