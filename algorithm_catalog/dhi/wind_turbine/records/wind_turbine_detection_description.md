# Description

Predicts wind turbine locations for a given area and year. It analyzes Sentinel-2 images from October of the previous year to March of the requested year to generate results. The output is a GeoJSON file containing bounding boxes that indicate detected wind turbines. Each bounding box includes the date of the Sentinel-2 image in which the turbine was identified and the modelâ€™s confidence probability for the detection.

Restriction:_ This service can only be executed as a batch service. Please pay attention to the job_options that are provided in the example as these are required to execute the service.
